  "What number is this? <say-as interpret-as=\"cardinal\">3.14159265359</say-as>",
  "<prosody volume=\"+4dB\" pitch=\"low\" rate=\"x-slow\">Now I sound like a computer. Let me perform a calculation. For the equation x squared plus 3 x plus 2 equals 0, the possible values of x are negative 2 and negative 1.</prosody>",
  "<prosody volume=\"+4dB\" pitch=\"x-high\" rate=\"fast\">Want a plane that loops the loop. Me, I want a hula hoop. I sound like a chipmunk</prosody>",
  "You can also have me say complete nonsense by telling me the exact sounds I should make using the international phonetic alphabet. <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"əzæʒsoʊlɹfd͡ʒbɪɔɪpʃt͡ʃɔɪʌsoʊlɹfd͡ɪpʒspʃt͡lɹffd͡ʒbɪæʒsolɹfd͡ɪpʒspʃt͡ləzæʒsoʊlɹfd͡ʒbɪɔɪpʃt͡ʃɔɪʌsoʊlɹfd͡ɪpʒspʃt͡lɹffd͡ʒbɪæʒsolɹfd͡ɪpʒspʃt͡l\">lame</phoneme>",
